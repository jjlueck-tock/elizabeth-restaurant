<pre>

Thank you for visiting this website, which is owned and operated by Iryna, LLC, doing business as "Elizabeth Restaurant" (the "Company," "Elizabeth Restaurant," "we" or "us")!

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Elizabeth Restaurant web site located at  http://www.elizabeth-restaurant.com and any successor web site(s) established by the Company which references these Terms, and any data or content available through such web sites (collectively, the "Site"), and constitutes a binding legal agreement between the Company and you. BY USING, VISITING OR BROWSING THE SITE, OR BY REGISTERING OR SIGNING UP FOR AN ACCOUNT WITH NEXT, YOU HEREBY ACCEPT, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. If you do not want to be governed by these Terms, then please exit this page immediately and do not view or use the Site or register or establish an account on the Site.

Changes to the Terms of Use

The Internet and technology are rapidly changing. Accordingly, we may modify this Agreement from time to time. We will contact you if we do so, which is why it is important that you notify us immediately if your email address changes. If you are a registered user, you will be asked to click to accept the new agreement the next time you log on to this Site in order to be able to use the interactive portions of this Site. We will also put any revised versions of this Agreement on this Site with a notice advising of the change. It is therefore important that you regularly check this Site for any announcements about revisions and keep your contact information current to ensure you are informed of any changes.

THESE TERMS MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME BY NEXT IN ITS DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. We indicate at the top of the page when these Terms were last modified or updated. Your continued use of the Site following such changes will be deemed acceptance of such changes. Upon our request, you agree to sign a non-electronic version of these Terms.

NOTE: The use by you, or anyone authorized by you, of machines, computers, scripts or any automated system on the Site is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal liability under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Section 1030 of the United States Code and/or under applicable laws in other jurisdictions.

Reservations, Ticket Purchase and Payment

Unlike an a la carte restaurant with many walk-in customers and dozens of menu items, Elizabeth Restaurant is creating a truly unique dining experience and doing so at an amazing price. By eliminating no-shows, requiring pre-payment, and varying the price by time and day we are able to create a predictable and steady flow of patrons allowing us to offer a great deal more than would otherwise be possible at these prices.

Upon making a reservation via the Site and making payment in full, you will be issued a "ticket" (each, an "Elizabeth Ticket") setting forth the time of the pre-paid reservation, the number in your party. However, to be sure, Elizabeth Tickets are only allowed to be purchased via the Site in increments of two (2) or four (4).  We will send you an email confirmation and issue a unique confirmation number immediately on our site. When arriving at Elizabeth Restaurant please have the confirmation number and name the credit card you used to purchase the Elizabeth Ticket.  [For a greater number of such Tickets, or for an odd number thereof, please call the restaurant directly.]

Elizabeth Restaurant accepts several methods of payment to accommodate your needs: American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and Diner's Club.

Just like a sporting event, concert, or theater ticket, all Elizabeth Ticket sales are final.
Pricing at Elizabeth Restaurant is variable and depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the cost and length of our current menu, and the time and day of the week you choose to dine.

The Company reserves the right to add extra tickets at late notice should we deem it possible to serve more patrons.

Your Elizabeth Ticket is completely transferable. However, you should be aware that selling tickets for greater than face value may be illegal in your area. Any Elizabeth Ticket purchased on the secondary market is at the purchaser's risk. We will not be held responsible for forgeries or misrepresentations.

Unlawful resale (or attempted resale), counterfeit or copy of any Elizabeth Ticket is grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation. In addition, the Company reserves the right to restrict or deny Elizabeth Ticket purchasing privileges to anyone that the Company determines to be, or has been, in violation of this policy. Because the Company does not guarantee the authenticity of Elizabeth Tickets purchased from any non-authorized third party reseller (such as brokers or individuals), The Company recommends that you purchase Elizabeth Tickets directly through The Company to ensure ticket authenticity. Elizabeth Tickets may not be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, unless formal written authorization is given by a duly authorized representative of The Company, provided that even if such consent is obtained, any use of The Company's trademarks and other intellectual property is subject to The Company's consent.

You cannot buy Elizabeth Tickets for more than 4 people in our main dining room. Parites can be booked out for six or eight or an even number but must be done by telephone. Elizabeth Restaurant is a small restaurant and the menus are intricate. We have limited seating choices in order to provide the best possible experience.
If you wish to purchase Elizabeth Tickets (each such purchase, a "Transaction,"), you will be asked by the Company or our service provider to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that any such information will be treated by the Company in the manner described in our Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://www.elizabeth-restaurant.com/website/pp, and which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. You agree that all information that you provide to the Company or such third party provider will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred, including any applicable service charges. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your purchases. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant The Company the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.

Descriptions or images of, or references to, products or services on the Website do not imply Elizabeth Restaurant's endorsement of such products or services. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to change such descriptions or references; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all Transaction(s); to limit the order quantity on any product or service; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or service. Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to Elizabeth Restaurant's acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. Refunds and exchanges will be subject to Elizabeth Restaurant's refund and exchange policies then in effect.

You agree that all purchases made by you on the Website cannot be exchanged and are non-refundable. All purchases are subject to Elizabeth Restaurant's service fees and charges, which are also non-refundable. You will be responsible for paying all applicable taxes in connection with your purchase of any tickets.
